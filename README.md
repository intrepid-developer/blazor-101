Getting started with Blazor

## About This Project

This is a demo repository showcasing the main render modes available in Blazor. It demonstrates how different rendering strategies can be used to build modern web applications with .NET.

## Blazor Render Modes

This project includes examples of three primary Blazor render modes:

- **Hybrid (SSR/Server/WASM)** - Combines server-side rendering with interactive server and WebAssembly components for optimal performance and flexibility
- **SSR (Server-Side Rendering)** - Pure server-rendered pages for fast initial load times and SEO-friendly content
- **WASM (WebAssembly)** - Standalone client-side application running entirely in the browser
